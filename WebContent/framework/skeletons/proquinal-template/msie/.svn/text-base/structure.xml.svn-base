<!--
    There are no "msie" specific specializations for the "borderless" skeleton theme, so the "borderless" theme
    in the context of this "msie" classification is configured to simply point to the "bighorn" skeleton
    "borderless" theme directory.
    
    Developers wishing to provide customizations to the "borderless" theme should update the path below to point
    to a custom classification or custom skeleton directory as appropriate.
