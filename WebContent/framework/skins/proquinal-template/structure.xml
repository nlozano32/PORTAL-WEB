<!--
    There are no "bighorn-template" specific specializations for the "borderless" skin theme, so the "borderless"
    theme in the context of this "bighorn-template" skin is configured to simply point to the "bighorn" skin
    "borderless" theme directory.

    Developers wishing to provide customizations to the "borderless" theme should create a local "borderless"
    directory, copy the contents of the "bighorn" skin "borderless" theme directory to the local directory,
    and update the path below to point to the local "borderless" directory.

    A local "msie" classification directory is provided to ease configuration.  This "msie" classification directory
    is configured with search paths appropriate for both "msie" specific and general skin overrides.
